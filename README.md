## Process to optimize the website

The first thing I did was go through all the <div> classifications to the see which ones could be changes to other HTML element references. Many of them could be changes to things like <header> <footer> <main> <img> and <nav>.
The next thing I found was that some of the sections had superfluous ID classifications when it already had a class classification that was being called with all the iformation needed.
Then in the CSS file there were multiple classes that had the same rules set in them. I simplified these into classes that all of the target sections in HTML can use in order to not have extra rules in CSS.
I also needed to change some of the class targets to plain HTML element reference key words in order to make the CSS targert sections of code that no longer needed a superfluous class.
From there I needed to add to add <alt> elements to the images that were given in order to make the webpage more accessible.
